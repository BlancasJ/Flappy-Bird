# Flappy Bird
***
Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating the brid through pairs of pipes that have equally sized gaps placed at random heights. The bird automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the space key.
